     Refugees face language barriers and thus have difficulties acclimatizing to 
     life outside of their home country. This not only prevents them from gaining
     employment, but also stymies further education, adjusting to society and
     integrating with local populations.

      commonly used phrases that they can put into practice. They would also like
      to learn vocational skills to seek steady, gainful employment fast.

      Refugees may occasionally be in need of information and services. In such a case
      they can contact each other and chat privately to help each other out. Suppose 
      they need help with IT or cooking or something simple - they can find people based 
      on skills and ask them questions privately.
