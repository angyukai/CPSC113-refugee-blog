__General Updates__

One major concern which Kyle pointed out was learning quickly about our original customers (who were refugees in Europe), primarily due to geographical and language barriers. We therefore decided to shift our focus to Syrian Refugees within the state of Connecticut as it would be more manageable considering the timescale of this course. According to the International Refugee and Immigrant Services (IRIS) based in New Haven, there were 487 refugees within the state of Connecticut as of FY13. http://www.irisct.org/facts.html This provides us with a large enough sample size to conduct interviews and trials on our product. We will also be conducting an interview with Kate Wood, an IRIS case worker who helps Syrian refugees in New Haven find temporary shelters, to learn more about the refugee situation and potentially challenge our current assumptions of our perceived problems/solutions. 

__Who is your customer or customers?:__
- Refugees in New Haven and the state of Connecticut. (487 as of FY13)

__What is their pain?:__
- In a foreign unknown land with no peer support and few friends.
- Not knowing where to find affordable medical facilities, clothing, housing, food i.e. useful local information
- Not familiar with laws and norms.
- Culture and Language barrier.


__What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?:__
- A web app which refugees can create an account and log into to 1) increase the communication among refugees to create a peer support network 2) provide refugees with important information of events through twitter feeds or locations on a map (e.g. where to get cheap clothing, medical supplies or just events catered towards refugees)

__How do you know these things?:__
- Primary sources: 
- We will be conducting an interview with a caseworker who has been helping refugees find temporary shelter in New Haven, as well as provide us with in-depth information about the daily struggles and pressing concerns of the refugees that we may be able to address
- Upon establishing contact we may be able to talk to some of the refugees in Connecticut to gather first-hand experience, as well as second-hand experience about other refugees elsewhere in the United States.
- First hand experience
- Secondary sources:
- News reports on refugees
- Accounts of people on the ground and documented interviews with refugees.


__How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?:__
- Initially, we will reach the refugees with the help of current NGOs, like the International Refugee and Immigrants Service (IRIS) based in New Haven, to learn more about the refugee situation and create a network of potential customers/users.
- We will refine our product based on this information and reach out to the potential customers/users again to propose our solution to their problems, using word-of-mouth and sharing online through social networks and NGO websites.
- In the long term we may make this a software service that the government requires migrants to be subscribed to.

__How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?:__
- Non Profit. We will generate revenues to ensure that the venture is sustainable through partnering with stores that want to advertise clothing or service options to migrants. 
- We would also use funding from NGOs working in this field and organizations working on the ground, as well as provide the option for individuals and organizations to donate to this cause.

__What are the biggest risks? (Imagine you fast forward three months that your idea turns out to be bad and that it fails. What are the top five reasons you think it would have failed?):__
- A technological solution being insufficient to successfully address  the problem we are trying to solve
- Inadequate funding and financial support from organizations as we develop and try to bring the product to market
- Data sources do not turn out to be as dependable as we thought in determining hostility of regions, etc.
- Populations are hesitant to adopt the solution due to the perception that the benefits of the app are not enough to justify signing up, or leave once they feel that they are done with the application
- Government regulations prohibit parts of our service to prevent illegal migrant inflow

__Now that you know the biggest risks, how could you most swiftly allay your fears about them? Can you speak to particular users and ask them particular questions? Can you build a particular "low fidelity" version of your software? Can you do something crazy like "fake" your software using a mix of Google spreadsheets and SMS messages?:__
- Speaking to users will be key throughout this process. I think we could definitely prevent some of the mentioned problems through interviewing, but government regulation may be difficult to get around.
- It would be difficult to build something out of spreadsheets and SMS messages, but we could create a pre determined map based on data collated in research to start with.
- We also need to identify factors and use cases that would keep a user coming back and continue using the application.


__You will be graded, in part, on the amount of "impact" you can achieve in this class. Here, impact is roughly the amount of value you are adding to people's lives times the number of people using your software at the end of the semester. How can you maximize that? What do you need to build?:__
- The best way we can maximize impact is by surveying and interviewing a large variety of migrants currently displaced in New Haven and Connecticut and estimate the change that we have brought to their lives through testimonials from them.
- We need to build a system that can collect data that applies to migrants within the state of Connecticut. How this data is displayed will be important, but the actual collection of all relevant data will help us get as much information to migrants as possible.
 
__Describe to us how the software will function. Try to phrase this in some kind of user narrative:__
- As a user, I can log in. I can see information about migration trends and responses to migration in my local area. I can see fellow users close to me and establish contact and communicate with them.
- As a user any time I send a tweet with #nameOfApp and the information will be analyzed by our system. I can log in to my account and there will ultimately be three different views. The first view is just a profile with a newsfeed and alerts based on data collected that is relevant to your interests, background, and current location. 
- The second view is a map of the my local area (in this case, Connecticut) and maybe neighbouring states too) which graphically displays relevant information of a certain region to the refugees (e.g. the locals reception to refugees, state laws on refugees, areas to look for help)

 
__Describe to us the application architecture and technical choices needed to build that software. How is it divided between client and server? How do they communicate? How are you storing data? How will you manage, test, and deploy your code?:__
- On the server side, we will be storing our user profiles, regional information and information relayed by tweets in databases. We may use a graph database for users and a document based non relational database for data. The data on the server side will be used to create our views that the users will see. On the client side, our HTML/CSS view layer will respond to user inputs. Our aim, in the MVP, is to build a user-friendly interface. When refugees register on our app, their information will be sent to the server-side, where it will be stored. Any preferences that a user indicates in their profile, upon registering or even at any point later on, will also be stored on the server-side. 
- On the client side, they will also have the option to communicate with others in the local area, and this chat information will be stored on our servers as well.
- In order to overcome the language barrier, our content may need to be translated as well. To start, we can dynamically translate the page using Google translate based on the userâ€™s specified language settings, and consider moving to a more reliable translation process in the future.
