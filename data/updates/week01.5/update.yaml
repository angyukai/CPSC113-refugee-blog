title: Refining and simplfying our MVP.
summary: |
    Instead of jumping into a complicated app, we decided to craft our MVP as a wordpress 'newsletter' site to provide information and learn more about the refugees problems

_Who is your customer or customers?:__
4.1 Million refugees have fled Syria since the beginning of the civil war in 2011. While a large number of them have emigrated to Europe and neighbouring countries. In the USA at the moment, there are 1500 Syrian refugees, with the State Department claiming that it could accept up to 8000 more this year. 

In the US, there are refugees from other countries as well. The three countries with the largest number of refugees hailing from them were Burma (118,476), Iraq (93,788) and Bhutan (70,341). Below is chart of the top 20 countries that refugees hailed from.

There are approximately 487 Syrian refugees in the state of Connecticut, who will function as our pilot users, and based on our learnings from them, we will expand to address issues.

There are also several organizations, both governmental and NGOs who are interested in providing assistance to the refugee population. The US Government spends approximately 1.2 billion on refugees, which is approximately 7000-14000 per refugee. Our goal is to connect refugees living in the United States with each other to establish a peer support network and connect them to organizations willing to help them emotionally, logistically and financially.
__What is their pain?:__
For the first 90 days after refugees arrive, the contracted resettlement agency is responsible for providing them with food, shelter, medical care and other services. Beyond these 90 days, however, refugees are on their own in a foreign country with no peer support from fellow Syrian natives and few friends. Beyond these 90 days, refugees may suffer from issues such as not knowing where to find affordable medical facilities, clothing, housing, food i.e. useful local information. 

The response to these domestic refugees is often "Not in my backyard!" Resentment and xenophobia towards refugees makes it difficult for them to assimilate. A cultural and language barrier also makes it difficult for refugees to integrate and assimilate in the US and Europe.

__What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?:__
For our MVP, we plan to prepare a simple wordpress landing site which provides information on health-care, accommodations or services provided for refugees in the United States, with a focus on New Haven and Connecticut state. Using Google analytics, we will track how many people visit the site, and what pages they engage with the most (measured using time spent on page, number of shares of the particular page/article, number of links on page clicked, etc) and use it to determine which issues are of greatest importance.
We will also provide a direct channel for feedback and queries so that people can directly email us with their questions and comments, allowing us further insight into how to improve the site and what features to add.

__How do you know these things?:__
Primary sources: 
- We will be conducting an interview with a caseworker who has been helping refugees find temporary shelter in New Haven, as well as provide us with in-depth information about the daily struggles and pressing concerns of the refugees that we may be able to address
- Upon establishing contact we may be able to talk to some of the refugees in Connecticut to gather first-hand experience, as well as second-hand experience about other refugees elsewhere in the United States.
- First hand experience
Secondary sources:
- News reports on refugees
- Accounts of people on the ground and documented interviews with refugees.


__How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?:__
- Initially, we will reach the refugees with the help of current NGOs, like the International Refugee and Immigrants Service (IRIS) based in New Haven, to learn more about the refugee situation and create a network of potential customers/users.
- We will refine our product based on this information and reach out to the potential customers/users again to propose our solution to their problems, using word-of-mouth and sharing online through social networks and NGO websites.
- In the long term we may make this a software service that the government requires migrants to be subscribed to.

__How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?:__
- Non Profit. We will generate revenues to ensure that the venture is sustainable through partnering with stores that want to advertise clothing or service options to migrants. 
- We would also use funding from NGOs working in this field and organizations working on the ground, as well as provide the option for individuals and organizations to donate to this cause.

__What are the biggest risks? (Imagine you fast forward three months that your idea turns out to be bad and that it fails. What are the top five reasons you think it would have failed?):__
- A technological solution being insufficient to successfully address  the problem we are trying to solve
- Inadequate funding and financial support from organizations as we develop and try to bring the product to market
- Data sources do not turn out to be as dependable as we thought in determining hostility of regions, etc.
- Populations are hesitant to adopt the solution due to the perception that the benefits of the app are not enough to justify signing up, or leave once they feel that they are done with the application
- Government regulations prohibit parts of our service to prevent illegal migrant inflow

__Now that you know the biggest risks, how could you most swiftly allay your fears about them? Can you speak to particular users and ask them particular questions? Can you build a particular "low fidelity" version of your software? Can you do something crazy like "fake" your software using a mix of Google spreadsheets and SMS messages?:__
- Speaking to users will be key throughout this process. I think we could definitely prevent some of the mentioned problems through interviewing, but government regulation may be difficult to get around.
- It would be difficult to build something out of spreadsheets and SMS messages, but we could create a pre determined map based on data collated in research to start with.
- We also need to identify factors and use cases that would keep a user coming back and continue using the application.


__You will be graded, in part, on the amount of "impact" you can achieve in this class. Here, impact is roughly the amount of value you are adding to people's lives times the number of people using your software at the end of the semester. How can you maximize that? What do you need to build?:__
- The best way we can maximize impact is by surveying and interviewing a large variety of migrants currently displaced in New Haven and Connecticut and estimate the change that we have brought to their lives through testimonials from them.
- We need to build a system that can collect data that applies to migrants within the state of Connecticut. How this data is displayed will be important, but the actual collection of all relevant data will help us get as much information to migrants as possible.
 
__Describe to us how the software will function. Try to phrase this in some kind of user narrative:__
- As a user, I can log in. I can see information about migration trends and responses to migration in my local area. I can see fellow users close to me and establish contact and communicate with them in real time.
- As a user any time I send a tweet with #nameOfApp and the information will be analyzed by our system. I can log in to my account and there will ultimately be three different views. The first view is just a profile with a newsfeed and alerts based on data collected that is relevant to your interests, background, and current location. 
- The second view is a map of the my local area (in this case, Connecticut) and maybe neighbouring states too) which graphically displays relevant information of a certain region to the refugees (e.g. the locals reception to refugees, state laws on refugees, areas to look for help)

 
__Describe to us the application architecture and technical choices needed to build that software. How is it divided between client and server? How do they communicate? How are you storing data? How will you manage, test, and deploy your code?:(For the MVP)__
- We will be using a web hosting service such as WordPress to host our website and Google Analytics to monitor site activity. Since there is no technical sophistication to the site yet, we do not need our own dedicated servers, as we are mostly collecting insights from a static page at this point.

__For what we currently envision the final app will be:__
- On the server side, we will be storing our user profiles, regional information and information relayed by tweets in databases. We may use a graph database such as Neo4j for storing users and their relationships and a document-based non relational database such as MongoDB for other data. 
- To facilitate direct communication between users, we will most likely use an XMPP messaging system
- The twitter feed would use twitter’s API and the feed would be updated periodically by querying the twitter database for tweets with the app’s hashtag
- Our aim, in the MVP, is to build a minimalist, mobile-first, user-friendly interface with design decisions being influenced by practical considerations such as bandwidth and data usage. When refugees register on our app, their information will be sent to the server-side, where it will be stored in the graph database. Any preferences that a user indicates in their profile, upon registering or even at any point later on, will also be stored on the server-side. 
- On the client side, they will also have the option to communicate with others in the local area, and this chat information will be stored on our servers as well.
- In order to overcome the language barrier, our content may need to be translated as well. To start, we can dynamically translate the page using Google translate based on the user’s specified language settings, and consider moving to a more reliable translation process in the future.
