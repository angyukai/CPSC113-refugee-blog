title: Big changes
summary: | 

Working with refugees will be cumbersome in the near future, so ignore previous ideas. Insead, pivot into one of the two directions: (1) helping homeless people, (2) creating a web-based platform for various (low-key) dress designers in Muslim countries to sell their clothes to populations in the US

__We met with representatives from the Yale Refugee Project and IRIS to be able to extract more information about refugees – both these organizations have been actively involved in the past and were able to give us valuable information:__
- About two-thirds of the refugees in New Haven do not have smart-phones, which implies that they cannot readily access a web-based app
Most refugees do not want to identify as refugees. Using any app that is specifically designed for them means that they run the risk of giving up their identities when they sign up to use the app.
- Adult refugees require a lot of time to overcome some of the salient problems in their lives – such as learning English, honing skills that will land them with better employment opportunities
- After this meeting, we decided that it would not be a wise decision to go ahead with working with the New Haven refugee population. In our earlier updates, we ruled our refugee populations elsewhere since distance meant that we would not be able to directly engage with them at all. 

__Converstion with Kyle:__
During our conversation with Kyle we realized that it was in our best interest to begin to move past the consumer interview portion of our project, and to focus on getting some “tech” up for the purpose of this course. To gain experience with the development of a product and customer acquisition Kyle suggested we settle on an idea, create an MVP, and begin building our product as we get feedback. At this point, we have two new ideas:

__Idea 1__

- Instead of working with the refugee population, we decided to shift the focus of our project towards homeless people. They are a demographic of the population that is easy to engage with, and whose members actively identify with the group. In New Haven, homeless people can often be seen begging for money on the streets, which goes to show that these people are in need of help.
- Our idea is to humanize the problems that homeless people face by posting pictures of selected people online along with a story that provides an insight into their struggles (similar to Humans of New York); we hope that viewers of these pictures will empathize with the homeless to help them out in small ways such that some of the “wishes” of homeless people can be fulfilled. 
- Customer acquisition will be focused on college students who are the largest consumers of HONY (Humans of New York) and have expressed significant interest in learning more about impoverished communities across New haven.
- For testing purposes, we will make a Facebook page where we will post individual details of New Haven’s homeless people, as well as any wish they most desire to be fulfilled. 
- This would be a problem that has a lot of different opportunities for the use of tech to be part of the solution


__Idea 2__

- A large number of American Muslim women choose to follow the conservative Islamic code in terms of their dressing. However, mainstream American fashion retail outlets such as H&M, Gap, etc. only rarely offer them with any degree of variety. As a result, they are forced to seek out other options. 
- There are some web-based fashion retail stores, such as shukronline.com. However, these stores again only offer very limited variety, charge exorbitant prices, their websites are not very user friendly, the clothes are not of the best quality, etc. Another factor to account for is the fact that the Muslim population in America is very diverse: depending on their ethnicities, women desire different types of clothing for different occasions. South Asian women typically want the traditional shalwar-kameez, while Middle-Eastern women prefer long dresses and abayas. 
- Several American Muslim women, therefore, choose to buy clothes when they visit predominantly Muslim countries, where it is not nearly as difficult as it is in America to find clothing that is in line with Islamic values. 
- It is not very convenient, however, that these women get to update their wardrobes only if they visit a Muslim country, or if they are able to find a friend who has either recently returned with a stock of clothes or has received a shipment from a dress-designer based in a Muslim country. 
- There are also several low-key dress-designers who ship their clothes to the US periodically to have it sold in casual settings at their friends’ houses. 
- At present, therefore, even though a market for high-quality, affordable and fashionable Islamic clothing exists, there is no institution to make the task easier both for dress designers as well as the buyers.
- Our idea is to make a web-based portal where different designers from Muslim countries can post their designs for sale. Designers should be able to take orders, and buyers should be able to indicate specific measurements required for the dress/outfit. The website should indicate the price of the dress, as well as additional charges for shipping, etc. If the buyer wishes to specify modifications to an outfit that she wishes to order, she should be able to do so. 
- For our MVP, we will be focusing on dress designers based in Pakistan because we are aware that several designers exist there who are also interested in selling their clothes in the US.
