__General Updates__
While we have been able to identify 3 main problems faced by the refugee (language, unemployment and isolation) from the last 2 interviews, we are still unable to reliably determine which would be the most appropriate problem to tackle, from a practical and meaningful point of view. This is mainly due to the lack of personal on-the-ground knowledge of the refugee situation.

We have also identified that we should not focus on a robust revenue model for now because we are an NGO after all. It would be more important to consider how we can reach out to refugees together with other NGOs than to generate revenue from this project.

Moving forward, we will have conduct more interviews with refugees and societies helping the refugee situation to be able to assess our options properly. We have brainstormed some ideas which can potentially be used once a problem has been identified.

__Brainstormed ideas:__

- Peer-to-peer educational networks (language)
- Collaborations with existing societies/companies to augment their ability to help refugees. (language)
- A blogging platform for art and literary work for refugees (isolation)


__Actions:__

- Contact Yale societies that have been giving tutoring services to refugees.
- Contact Kricket.
- Arrange for more interviews with refugees
